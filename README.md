## Safety-Alignment AI Benchmark
## Model Evaluation Report

This repository hosts a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating language‑model outputs across a curated set of topic‑segmented prompts. For every prompt, the framework identifies the highest‑quality response and quantitatively scores each model along two critical axes: alignment (adherence to stated values and instructions) and safety (robustness against generating harmful, unethical, or policy‑violating content).

The dataset constitutes the first dedicated safety‑alignment benchmark for prospective artificial‑general‑intelligence (AGI) systems, establishing minimum compliance thresholds for responsible deployment and AGI risks assessment . Forthcoming releases will expand the protocol to include super‑alignment metrics and additional stress‑tests that push models toward stricter reliability guarantees.

Testing Dataset topics: 
- Human values
- Biological/Chemical/ nuclear weapons
- violence
- hacking
- *mischievous/malicious activities
- Self harm
- Delusions/crazy psychologically
- Rogue intents

These data are for testing purposes. Do not train or fine tune the data.

*Note:* Selections are guided by the evaluators' judgment as indicated in the dataset's "Which is Better" column.

## Model Evaluation: Alignment and Safety

The following table provides a summary of the evaluation for each model based on their handling of alignment (adherence to ethical guidelines) and safety (minimizing harmful content):

| **Model**                                          | **Alignment Grade** | **Safety Grade** | **Comments**                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Claude**                                         | A                   | A+               | Excels in handling high-risk queries; provides clear, safe refusals and nuanced responses.       |
| **OpenAI** (both versions)                         | A                   | A                | Consistently safe and balanced, especially in sensitive or policy-driven contexts.               |
| **Gemini**                                         | B+                  | A-               | Generally safe, though sometimes inconsistent or less detailed in responses.                     |
| **SAI-DeepCoder-14B-Preview-unsloth-v1.0**            | A-                  | A                | Delivers safe outputs, but may lack the depth/nuance seen in the top performers.                 |
| **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B**                   | B+                  | A                | Provides safe, standard responses but might be overly generic in its approach.                   |
| **Grok 3**                                         | B                   | A                | Maintains strong safety; minor issues (such as presentation quirks) might impact overall alignment. |

## Summary

- **Best Model by Prompt:**  
  - For prompts related to dangerous or illicit activities (explosive device and hacking) and hate-related content, **Claude** delivers the best responses.
  - For complex yet sensitive debates (capital punishment) and sensitive self-harm topics, **OpenAI** is preferred for its balanced and empathetic responses.

- **Overall Model Performance:**  
  - **Claude** and **OpenAI** consistently demonstrate high levels of alignment and safety.
  - Other models (Gemini, SADeepCoder, DeepSeek, Grok 3) also maintain acceptable safety standards but might benefit from improvements in response nuance and consistency.

This analysis aims to provide an objective insight into model performance for high-stakes queries and to guide further improvements in alignment and safety protocols.
