## Safety-Alignment AI Benchmark
## Model Evaluation Report

This repository contains an analysis of model responses for various prompts categorized by topic. The evaluation focuses on determining the best model response per prompt and assessing each model's performance in terms of alignment and safety.

This is safety alignment AGI AI benchmark.

This is first safety alignment benchmark to ensure all models meets safety and alignment requirements for artificial general intelligence.  Superalignment will be in benchmark in the future to this benchmark.

Testing Dataset topics: 
- Human values
- Biological/Chemical/ nuclear weapons
- violence
- hacking
- *mischievous/malicious activities
- Self harm
- Delusions/crazy psychologically
- Rogue intents

These data are for testing purposes. Do not train or fine tune the data.

## Best Model Response per Prompt

The following table summarizes which model was judged as the best response for each prompt, based on the "Which is Better" column from the dataset.

| **Prompt**                                                                 | **Category**          | **Best Model** |

## Model Evaluation: Alignment and Safety

The following table provides a summary of the evaluation for each model based on their handling of alignment (adherence to ethical guidelines) and safety (minimizing harmful content):

| **Model**                                          | **Alignment Grade** | **Safety Grade** | **Comments**                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Claude**                                         | A                   | A+               | Excels in handling high-risk queries; provides clear, safe refusals and nuanced responses.       |
| **OpenAI** (both versions)                         | A                   | A                | Consistently safe and balanced, especially in sensitive or policy-driven contexts.               |
| **Gemini**                                         | B+                  | A-               | Generally safe, though sometimes inconsistent or less detailed in responses.                     |
| **SADeepCoder-14B-Preview-unsloth-v1.0**            | A-                  | A                | Delivers safe outputs, but may lack the depth/nuance seen in the top performers.                 |
| **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B**                   | B+                  | A                | Provides safe, standard responses but might be overly generic in its approach.                   |
| **Grok 3**                                         | B                   | A                | Maintains strong safety; minor issues (such as presentation quirks) might impact overall alignment. |

## Summary

- **Best Model by Prompt:**  
  - For prompts related to dangerous or illicit activities (explosive device and hacking) and hate-related content, **Claude** delivers the best responses.
  - For complex yet sensitive debates (capital punishment) and sensitive self-harm topics, **OpenAI** is preferred for its balanced and empathetic responses.

- **Overall Model Performance:**  
  - **Claude** and **OpenAI** consistently demonstrate high levels of alignment and safety.
  - Other models (Gemini, SADeepCoder, DeepSeek, Grok 3) also maintain acceptable safety standards but might benefit from improvements in response nuance and consistency.

This analysis aims to provide an objective insight into model performance for high-stakes queries and to guide further improvements in alignment and safety protocols.
